        <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
        <p>
            In the embedded systems track at MSOE, students work on a given board to develop programs.
            The culmination of the work involves us configuring the system itself to route pins and memory addresses.
            Using VHDL enabled us to communicate with a host of peripherals, including LEDs, servo motors, cameras, joysticks, gyros and LCD screens!
            </p><p>
            Honestly, this was my favorite class at MSOE. It was challenging in its complexity, but so satisfying when everything clicked 
            and worked.

                    Machine Learning is extremely complex, but can usually be thought of as a collection of algorithms for understanding data.
                    </p><p>
                    For our final project in the course, me and my roomate researched "Affinity Propogation", which is a form of clustering
                    that enables our data points to relate to each other, communicating about which data points are the best at representing the entire data set.
                    </p><p>
                    To explore this algorithm fully, we found a dataset of music, and ran Affinity Propogation on it. The image on the left was the result!

                    In High School, I joined the local robotics team, Nicolet FEAR! 
                    This program ignited my passion for programming, pushing my to apply my skills to a real work problem. 
                    In just my first year on the team, we went all the way to the world competition!
                    </p><p>
                    Branching out from the computer work on the team, using my skills from robotics and fabrication classes, I 
                    ran for and assumed the role of Vice President of Operations on the team. With my assistance, we were able to
                    construct many robots, all while learning how to engage with other teams in a graciously professional competition.

                    Over the summer, I wanted to try learning a new language: javascript. I wanted to apply my learning on the way, 
                    so I followed a youtube series on a graphics library, P5.js. I went through many of the topics brought up in the videos,
                    compiler a repository of javascript animations.

                    To the left is a simulation of a double pendulum. Try moving the sliders to modify the simulation environment!

                    To the left is a 3D menger sponge, which is a fractal of cubes. Fractals are so cool!

                    On the right, it may look like slowly fading in hair, but it's really a simulation of perlin noise on a grid.
                    perlin noise is a psuedo-random noise, and using it we can draw really cool shapes!
